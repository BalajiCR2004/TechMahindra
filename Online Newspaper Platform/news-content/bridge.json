    "paragraph": "The Tamil Nadu government has approved a ₹177 crore project for the construction of 34 bridges across various districts to improve connectivity and repair flood-damaged infrastructure. The initiative prioritizes bridges requested through the Chief Minister's 'Ungal Thoguthiyil Muthalamaichar' program, as well as those needed due to flood damage and local connectivity issues.\n\nInitially, 84 bridges were proposed, but only 34 have been approved for funding using state resources instead of the planned NABARD-RIDF assistance. Out of these, 24 bridges were selected based on public petitions, five will replace flood-damaged structures, and five will improve regional connectivity.\n\nSalem district will receive six bridges across P N Palayam, Attur, Gangavalli, and Ayothipattinam blocks. Krishnagiri district, significantly affected by floods, will see new bridges in Uthangarai and Veppanapalli blocks.\n\nTrichy, Vellore, and Villupuram districts will each get three bridges, while Namakkal and Tuticorin will receive two each. Other districts receiving one bridge include Coimbatore, Cuddalore, Dindigul, Dharmapuri, Erode, Madurai, The Nilgiris, Tiruppur, Thanjavur, Tirunelveli, and Virudhunagar.", "keywords": ["Tamil Nadu", "bridges", "infrastructure", "flood damage", "road connectivity", "government project", "public petitions", "districts", "NABARD-RIDF"]
